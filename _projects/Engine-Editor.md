## About
For the Metal Dawn project, my main task was to develop a graphical user interface for the custom engine that my team and I developed. During my development, I was able to learn more about data-driven development and User Experience. With each backend feature that I had created an interface for, I had to learn about how each feature worked and how I can best implement the user interface for it whilst keeping in mind the user experience for our designers who would be using the interface. The custom engine was built with the C++ programming language and OpenGL API. The editor was made with C++ and Dear ImGui.

Below is a short demonstration & how-to video that I had made to showcase the engine's editor.
