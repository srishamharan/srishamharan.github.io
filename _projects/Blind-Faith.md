## About
Blind Faith is a top down 2D tile maze co-op game based
around 2 characters Castor & Pollux. In the game, one player will control
Castor who is a weak mage in training whose only spell reveals a small area of
the world to Pollux who is a blind swordsman that will be the other player to
see. The two must work together to navigate the labyrinth filled with evil
skeletons out to kill the living and try and escape but if they kill too many
enemies, they will enrage their other friends and more will spawn.
