Hey there! I'm Sri **Sham** Haran

I am a student currently pursuing a Bacholor of Science in Computer Science in Real-Time Interactive Simulation at Digipen Institute of Technology Singapore. My passion lies in developing XR solutions, inspired by the ideas presented by many Sci-Fi films of having an augmented world. I love playing all kinds of video games. Some of my favourite video games would be inclusive of Prince of Persia(1990), To The Moon, Euro Truck Simulator 2, Firewatch and many more.
